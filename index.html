        <h1>Andrea So</h1>

        <p>My name is Andrea So and I graduated from UBC in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in speech sciences. Speech sciences is the production, perception and transmission of speech sounds. It was a discipline under the Department of Linguistics. What do you do with such a degree? Most of my classmates have gone on to do their Master's degree in speech pathology or audiology. When I graduated, I got a job working in the product development department of a medium sized insurance company. Basically, I helped write and edit legalese that no one ever reads. From time to time, I also got to look for bugs in the B2C system because we were in charge of insurance content and we needed to know if it was captured correctly in the system. And now, I'm here! Below is a photo of my friend and I at her annual Christmas party last month. I'm on the right.</p>
