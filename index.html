    <h1>Andrea So</h1>

    <p>My name is Andrea So and I graduated from UBC in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in speech sciences. Speech sciences is the production, perception and transmission of speech sounds. It was a discipline under the Department of Linguistics. What do you do with such a degree? Most of my classmates have gone on to do their Master's degree in speech pathology or audiology. When I graduated, I got a job working in the product development department of a medium sized insurance company. Basically, I helped write and edit legalese that no one ever reads. From time to time, I also got to look for bugs in the B2C system because we were in charge of insurance content and we needed to know if it was captured correctly in the system. And now, I'm here! Below is a photo of my friend and I at her annual Christmas party last month. I'm on the right.</p>

    <div style="background-color: burlywood">
        <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/20191086130"><strong>COMP 1712 (Business Analysis and System Design)</strong></a><p>Business Analysis and Systems Design is the study of concepts, processes and tools that professionals use to plan and develop information systems to industry standards. Students learn how to ask implicit questions, to create and document communication plans and to make better decisions prior to creating a software system. Beginning with an introduction to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), students work in teams to initiate the system process, analyze problems, discover requirements and create a logical design. Topics include: techniques used in the discovery of business requirements, traditional approaches to data and process modelling, entity-relationship diagrams, and an introduction to relational database normalization. Agile life cycles such as Scrum are also introduced and compared to more planned life cycles such as waterfall. By the end of this course, successful participants will be able to use tools and methods commonly used in industry to analyze, design, and implement information systems as confirmed by a term project.</p>

    <div style="background-color: coral">
        <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/20191086134"><strong>COMP 1930 (Projects I)</strong></a><p>Students learn to work in a collaborative environment and complete a small-scale software project: a web app. Design and managing of implementation concepts will be introduced: User Experience Design (XSD) and Agile methodology. The course takes students through the UX design process which includes creating and administering surveys & interviews, creating personas and user stories, designing wireframes, and performing user tests with a developed implementation that is based on the UX design process. Students will use the Agile methodology to manage the software process. Software management workflow also includes using version control, version control basics, utilizing web technologies (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, data persistence via NoSQL data technologies). Some of the JavaScript topics include DOM manipulation, event handling, web storage, AJAX calls and using JQuery in order to create a rich web app.</p>
